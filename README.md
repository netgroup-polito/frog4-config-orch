# Frog4 Configuration Orchestrator

This component aims to provide orchestrators a VNFs (Virtual Network Function) dynamic configuration service.
Such a configuration service is the logic core of the architecture, it pushes configurations into VNFs, retrieves and exports VNFs actual configuration states and communicates with a GUI.
The interactions between the configuration service and the agents are performed through rest API.
